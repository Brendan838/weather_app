# scheduleApp

Hello! This project involved using html, css, and javascript as well as some third party apis/libraries (bootstrap and moment.js) in order to create a business hours scheduler that stores any notes in local storage, displays the current time at the top of the page, and changes color by the hour (red for current hour, green for future, and red for past)
